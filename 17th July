Format : DETAILS OF AVAILABILITY OF METHOD VALIDATION / METHOD VERIFICATION / METHOD TRANSFER

Comment after Category should be removed
As per "column 4" There should be selection for either "method validate" , "method Verified" and "method transfer"  as sometimes the method is validated, sometimes it is verified and sometimes it is transferred.
